\subsection{Transformation of the Entity-Relationship Schema}


\subsubsection{Redundancy Analysis}
The schema does not contain any cycle of entities.
\subsubsection{Choice of Principal Identifiers}
The main identifiers comply with the selection criteria.

\subsection{Analysis of Database Load}
Since there is not any derived attribute in the provided ER-Schema, we provide the load analysis as if the Book entity had the number of copies as derived attribute. Consider the following two operations that involve the redundant attribute 'numberofcopies': \newline
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{sections/Relation.jpeg} \newline
O1 - Insert new copy : store a new copy together with its book ID. 

O2 - Print data about a book: print all the data about a book, including the number of copies 

O3 - Summarise data about all the books: summarise all the data about all the books, including the number of copies 
In Table 3 the two operations are described.
Table 3: Operations description and frequency 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|}
\hline

    Operation & Description & Frequency & Type\\\hline
   
O1 : Add new copy & store a new copy together \\ &with book ID  & 100/day & Online \\\hline
O2 : Print data about a book & print all the data about a book, \\ &including the number of copies  & 2/day  & Online \\\hline
O3 : Summarize data about \\ all the books & summarize all the data about\\ & all the books, \\&including the number of copies  &1/week   & Batch \\\hline

   
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



In Table  4 we report the access/volume data related to O1 with redundancy. The Book entity has a read access to get the current value for "numberofcopies" attribute, and a write access to update this value. 

Table 4: Access/volume Table for Operation 1 with redundancy .\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{O1}\\\hline
    Concept & Construct & Access & Type & Average 
    Access\\\hline
    {Copy} &  {Entity} &  {1}  & {W}  & {1x100x2=200 }\\\hline
      {Belong } &  {Relationship} &  {1}  & {W}  & {1x100x2=200 }\\\hline
    {Book } &  {Entity} &  {1}  & {R}  & {1x100x1=100 }\\\hline
     {Book } &  {Entity} &  {1}  & {W}  & {1x100x2=200 }\\\hline

    \multicolumn{4}{|l}{Total Access}&\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{700}\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In Table  5 we report the access/volume data related to O2 with redundancy. The presence of redundancy allows us to perform one access to the Book entity to get all the required information. 

Table 5: Access/volume Table for Operation 2 with redundancy 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{O2}\\\hline
    Concept & Construct & Access & Type & Average 
    Access\\\hline
      {Book } &  {Entity} &  {1}  & {R}  & {1x2x1=2 }\\\hline

    \multicolumn{4}{|l}{Total Access}&\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{2}\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In Table  6 we report the access/volume data related to O1 without redundancy. In this case we have to consider the insertion of a new instance in copy, and the insertion of a new instance in belong  to store the book the copy joined. 

Table 6: Access/volume Table for Operation 1 without redundancy 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{O1}\\\hline
    Concept & Construct & Access & Type & Average Access\\\hline
{Copy} &  {Entity} &  {1}  & {W}  & {1x100x2=200 }\\\hline
      {Belong } &  {Relationship} &  {1}  & {W}  & {1x100x2=200 }\\\hline

    \multicolumn{4}{|l}{Total Access}&\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{400}\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In Table  7 we report the access/volume data related to O2 without redundancy. We considered 20 copies on average for each book. 

Table 7: Access/volume Table for Operation 2 without redundancy 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\multicolumn{5}{|l|}{O2}\\\hline

    Concept & Construct & Access & Type & Average Access\\\hline
         {Book } &  {Entity} &  {1}  & {R}  & {1x2x1=2  }\\\hline
      {Belong } &  {Relationship} &  {20}  & {R}  & {20x2x1=40 }\\\hline

   \multicolumn{4}{|l|}{Total Access}&\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{42}\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In Table  8 we report the final access count with and without redundancy. According to the obtained results, removing the redundant attribute from the group entity improves the load analysis. 

Table 8: Comparison of the number of accesses for each operation 


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|}
\hline
     Operation & With Redundancy & Without Redundancy\\\hline
    O1 & 700 & 400  \\\hline
    O2 & 2 & 42 \\\hline
    Total Access/Week & 702 & 442 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
        
        \item The admin can changes the book(add,delete,change price,change description) depending on his Role: we have to check the manageType and adminRole attributes to be compatible.
        \item The customer can only purchase the book which is available in the warehouses: a copy should be purchased if it's stockAvalability is TRUE.
        \item The package should be shipped by the shipper due to time limit that is announced in the website(for example it says in 3 working days it will be delivered): the placedTime and shipped\_ byDate should not violate this limit.
        \item The customer should only chat to the admin whose Role is Support: the adminRole must be Support.
    \end{itemize}
