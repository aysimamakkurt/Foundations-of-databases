\end{itemize}
Ainur Beisenova, Ali Aghababaei, Aysima Merve Akkurt, Elham Norouzimehmandoustolia and Erjol Sulku gave most of the ideas about the homework.The others contributed fewer suggestions because they are having various transitional issues. Elham Norouzimehmandoustolia has difficulties to make the commits in bitbucket since she is living in Iran, so her part is uploaded by other members of the group. Also Shima Shokrpour is facing the same issue. They have both limited access to the internet.
